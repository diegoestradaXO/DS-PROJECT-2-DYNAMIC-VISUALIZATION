## Getting Started
Make sure you download the two models used in this project, they can be found in this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RyUO0AqXreS5tEi6nm6r1y4iFWT71yGG/view?usp=sharing. Extract the zip file and place the models in the root folder.

```sh
python app.py
```
After running the application, the output should look something like this:
```sh
Dash is running on http://127.0.0.1:8050/
